# **Journey of Learning ** 

**For python I am following [Python for everyone](https://www.py4e.com/html3/02-variables)**

**Day 1** 
- * Basically the first few weeks of this journey will be me doing revision of my Python, Powershell or any other skills then we will catchup on every part, Today I learned about basic of python like Statement.Basic for Loop and while. Today I did more like setting up my WSL and ubuntu in that.*


**Day 2**

- * Note Time 12:20AM Technically, it should be the third day commit but I missed the commit. Today I learned about the making of server template and keeping the record of the hardward, Application, Disk. Now I will start studying about VPN*

**Day 3** 

- * Today I learned about VPN and some of it few terms but later on move to learn the ways to harden all the servers so built-in administrator user account can't be used. Instead of using the built-in Administrator account, we disable it and create named User with administrative privileges. These accounts follow the principals of least privilege and can be control better. Also, on top of that I did revision of group policy and ways to apply fined grained password*
