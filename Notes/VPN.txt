There is CIA triad to maintain, i.e Confidentiality, Authentication and Integrity.

Public Key Infrastructure. 
	It is a system that uses digital certification to secure online communication and verify identities. 

1) Certificate Authority
	It is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates 
2) Validy period
	When one is assiging certificate to the users, one must choose a validity period. 

Virtual Private Network (VPN)
	Case like WFM and everyother things expose our system directly to the Internet which can create security issues. 
When Connecting tot corportate services, remote endpints should encrypt data in transit so if anything along the way is compromised, the intercepted data is unrecoverable. This provides confidentiality. 

Types of VPN

Remote Access VPN 
	It securely connects users to internal resources
	It provide common pooint for users to authenticate and access data as if they were on local network.  

Site to Site 
	Tunnel configured between two devices in order to transparently connect remtoe locations securely over the internet as if they were directly connected while encrypting data to provide confidentiality.

	It provide common pooint for users to authenticate and access data as if they were on local network 

Types of VPN Topologies: 
	Hub & Spoke, Partial Mesh, Full Mesh 

Hairpining

	When using VPNs, it is posible that traffic may enter an interface and need to be rerouted out that same interfaces.This is common occurrence in hub and spoke, remote access VPN topologies.

Split tunnel VPN
	A split tunnel describe a VPN connection where corporate resources are delivered through the VPN, but general internet traffic is routed directly to the internet from local interface and doesn't cross the VPN.
